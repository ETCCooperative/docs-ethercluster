# Cloud Providers

To get started with building your Ethercluster, you'll need to have an account with a Cloud Provider.

A cloud provider basically is the place where you'll host your Ethercluster. Many companies provide
computing power and services that allow you to set up instances in data centers globally where your application
and other infrastructure live. Think of it as the foundation that stores your infrasturcture and application.

The following cloud providers you can use are:
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Azure Cloud
* Digital Ocean
