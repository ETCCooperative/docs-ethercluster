# Overview

This documentation guide is to help you build your own Ethercluster RPC infrastructure
step-by-step from scratch and learn a lot of DevOps tools used to build it.

We will be going over many different technologies and tools we will be using.

This design currently uses a Google-Cloud Cluster zone to building your infrastructure.
The interest in the future is to make Ethercluster a highly-available cluster across multiple 
cloud-providers and geographical locations.
